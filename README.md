# Mathematical Pendulum Motion Simulation
## Program Description  
This repository contains a simulation program for modeling the motion of a mathematical pendulum using the improved Euler method and the Runge-Kutta 4th order method.

The program aims to provide a calculation results (for easy visualization in e.g. Excel) of the pendulum's motion and analyze its energy dynamics.

## Usage
1. Run the program and provide the initial conditions for the pendulum, including parameters like angular velocity, length, mass and Î”t.
2. The program will simulate the motion of the pendulum using (depending on user's choice) the improved Euler method or the Runge-Kutta 4th order method.
3. The calculation results, will be displayed.
